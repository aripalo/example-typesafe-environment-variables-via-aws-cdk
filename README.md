# Example: Typesafe Environment Variables via AWS CDK

This repo is an accompanying resource to blog post: https://aripalo.technology/blog/2024/08/21/typesafe-environment-variables-via-aws-cdk/

## Examples

1. [No schema](/1-no-schema/) – Manual environment variable validation required
2. [Runtime schema](/2-runtime-schema/) – Zod schema to validate environment variables in runtime code
3. [Fully type safe](/3-fully-typesafe/) – Zod schema to validate environment variables in runtime code AND input contract for CDK
